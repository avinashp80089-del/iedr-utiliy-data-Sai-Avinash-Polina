# IEDR Utility Data Lakehouse

A scalable data platform that ingests electrical-circuit and DER (Distributed Energy Resource) data from multiple New York utilities and serves it through two API-ready queries - built on Databricks + PySpark + Delta Lake.

## What it does

Each utility delivers three CSV files per month (circuits, installed DERs, planned DERs). The pipeline normalizes them into a common data model so the IEDR application "does not have to be mindful of differences between source utility data" (case-prompt requirement) and exposes:

- **Feeder hosting capacity lookup** — every feeder where `max_hosting_capacity > X`
- **Feeder DER details** — every installed and planned DER on a given feeder, including data-quality flags for unresolved feeder IDs

Three layers, each Delta:

- **Bronze** — raw CSV ingestion, **partitioned by `(utility_id, batch_date)` and append-only**. Every monthly drop is preserved for audit and back-fill.
- **Silver** — utility-specific normalization → canonical `dim_feeder` and `fact_der`. Each utility's quirks live in its own adapter class + YAML config (no orchestration code changes when onboarding utility 3).
- **Platinum** — query-optimized API tables, partitioned and Z-ORDERED on the predicates the API actually filters on, plus a data-quality summary.

## Onboarding a new utility (the scaling story)

NY has 8 utilities; the pipeline is built so each new one is a configuration change, not a code rewrite:

1. Drop a CSV column-mapping at `config/utilities/utility3.yaml`
2. Add `Utility3Adapter(UtilityAdapter)` under `src/iedr/silver/adapters/`
3. Register it in `src/iedr/silver/adapters/__init__.py::ADAPTERS`
4. Add `utility3` to `config/pipeline.yaml` for the target env

The bronze ingest, silver orchestration, platinum build, and CI/CD workflows are untouched.

## Run tests locally

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                    # all tests
pytest tests/unit -v      # fast unit tests only
pytest tests/integration  # end-to-end on fixture CSVs
```

The test suite imports the **real** production code (no re-implementations), runs in ~30 seconds with a local Spark, and is gated in CI before any deploy.

## Deploy

```bash
databricks bundle deploy -t dev    # dev — auto on merge to main
databricks bundle deploy -t qa     # qa  — gated on dev success + GitHub environment review
databricks bundle deploy -t prod   # prod — gated on qa success + manual approval
```

Credentials are stored as GitHub repository secrets and injected by the `deploy.yml` workflow. Nothing hardcoded.
